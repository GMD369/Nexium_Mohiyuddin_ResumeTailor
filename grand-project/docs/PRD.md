## 1. Problem Statement

Most job seekers use the same resume for every job application, which reduces their chances of getting noticed by recruiters. Every job has different requirements, and a generic resume often fails to highlight the most relevant skills and experiences. As a result, candidates miss out on opportunities simply because their resume is not tailored to the job description.

---

## 2. Project Goal

To build an easy-to-use, AI-powered web application that helps users instantly generate a customized, job-specific resume. The app should allow users to paste their existing resume and a job description, and then receive a professionally tailored resume optimized for that job.

---

## 3. Target Users

- Fresh graduates looking for their first job
- Mid-level professionals aiming for better opportunities
- Freelancers and remote workers applying to multiple jobs
- Career switchers who need to highlight relevant skills for a new field

4. **AI (via n8n workflow)** processes the input, rewrites the resume to match the job description, and sends it back.
5. **User sees the tailored resume** on the right side of the screen, structured in clean paragraphs.
6. **User can edit the resume** directly in the browser if needed.
7. **User downloads the tailored resume as a PDF** or saves it to their account.

## 9. AI Flow (Technical)

- User input (resume + job description) is sent to the backend.
- Backend calls an n8n webhook.
- n8n workflow sends data to Gemini AI (or any LLM).
- AI rewrites the resume, focusing on job-relevant keywords, ATS optimization, and professional tone.
- n8n returns the tailored resume to the backend, which sends it to the frontend for display and download.

## 10. Future Improvements (Optional)

- Support for multiple languages.
- More advanced editing (drag-and-drop sections).
- Integration with job boards for one-click apply.
- Analytics dashboard for users to track job applications.
